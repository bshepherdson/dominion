- Replace 'Player N' with email addresses.
- Turn counter
- Some kind of notifications. What frameworks are out there? Email is a little slow, but easy to implement.
  - Is there any cross-platform notification system for iOS and Android devices? Anything that can be done without an app? Probably not.
    - Well unless I can get free SMS. Which might be possible, with the magic email thing.
  - Probably the best approach for that is to get a Dominion player familiar with developing apps for each platform to build one.
    - Neil can do both.
  - There's also browser urgency things like Gmail uses. I should look into that.
- More to the point, I need it working on mobile devices first. I'll try with the office iPad and iPhone, and my own Android.
  - Works great on iPad 3.2.1 and iPhone 3GS 4.1. No Flash support, no websockets support, falls back on xhr-polling and runs like a champ.
  - Gotta either get the Flash part working, or disabled, before it'll work on Android.
    - Should be disabled now.
