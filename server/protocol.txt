A description of the protocol over the socket between the client and server.

- Client loads the page, showing the lobby view initially.
- Client connects the socket
- Client sends { connect: [email, uid] }
- Server sends either { players: [...], is_host: true/false} listing names for the lobby list, or { game_started: 1 } if the game is underway (see below)

New game:
- The server occasionally sends { players: [...], is_host: true/false } messages showing the player list, which should be updated.
- If the client is the host, he has the button to send a { start_game: 1 } message.
- On game start the server sends everyone a { game_started: 1 }

After { game_started: 1 } we're back to the original protocol I've already implemented.
